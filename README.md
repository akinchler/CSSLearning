# CSS Learning

This is a library of all the projects and examples which I have completed
throughout the course of learning CSS.

## Course Followed

The course [The HTML & CSS Bootcamp 2024 Edition](https://www.udemy.com/course/html-and-css-bootcamp/learn/lecture/35813470#overview) by Colt Steele 
was the main content which I followed to learn CSS and a bit of HTML. 

## Usage

```
Open the html files via chrome or other browser to view
```
